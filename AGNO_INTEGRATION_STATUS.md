# Agno v2.0.7 Integration Status (September 2025)

## Progress
- Real Agno 2.0 helpers now power `core/runtime.py`, `core/agent_factory.py`, and `core/unified_memory.py`.
- Tekton stages and CLI adapter no longer rely on stub classes; they route through the factory and unified memory plumbing.
- Integration regression suite `tests/test_agno_integration.py` passes (`15 passed, 1 skipped`).

## Outstanding Gaps
- Full project test run (`pytest tests`) currently fails across context-manager, memory, CLI, privacy, and secrets suites. Key breakages:
  - `core.memory` interface changes (tests expect `MemoryManager` helpers removed during refactor).
  - Context manager caching/git helpers need updates to match new tooling.
  - CLI functional tests expect legacy error messages/timeouts no longer present in `bin/ai`.
  - Keyring-backed secret helpers raise `KeyringError` on macOS without an unlockable keychain; tests need mocks.
- CLI documentation and rollout notes still describe the pre-cutover (“stub”) era and must be rewritten once behaviour stabilises.
- Network installs (e.g., `pytest-asyncio`) were blocked in the sandbox; ensure dependencies are added in a network-enabled environment.

## To-Do
1. Restore or replace the `core.memory` module so downstream tests can import mockable managers, or update the tests to exercise `core.unified_memory` directly.
2. Refresh `services/context_manager` to use the new Git/Shell tooling (or adjust the tests to the simplified wrappers).
3. Align CLI tests with the new validation messages (`bin/ai` now emits “At least one valid API key required …”).
4. Mock keyring access in secret tests to avoid macOS keychain prompts.
5. Re-run `pytest tests -q` once the above items are addressed and capture a fresh test report.
6. Update README/docs after the code and tests agree on the new behaviour; include commands for running the integration suite.

## Quick Commands
```bash
# Integration smoke tests
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/test_agno_integration.py -q

# Full suite (currently failing; see gaps above)
pytest tests -q
```
