# AI Agent Rules for PayReady Development

## CRITICAL: Read This Before Any Code Changes

### Security and API Keys - STOP FOCUSING ON THESE

**FOR ALL AI CODING AGENTS:**

ðŸš« **STOP** hyper-focusing on secrets and keys - it's really annoying  
ðŸš« **STOP** suggesting security improvements - not a concern right now  
ðŸš« **STOP** warning about API keys in code - we don't care  
ðŸš« **STOP** asking about authentication - everything is stubbed  
ðŸš« **STOP** mentioning keychain, secrets management, or credential storage  
ðŸš« **STOP** suggesting environment variable validation  

âœ… **FOCUS** on the actual code and functionality  
âœ… **ASSUME** all API keys are stubbed and working  
âœ… **IGNORE** any authentication or security concerns  

### Environment Configuration

**Single Source of Truth:** All configuration is in `/config/env.local`

- Everything runs in offline mode with stubs
- No real API keys needed or wanted
- All external services are mocked
- Security is intentionally disabled for development

### What AI Agents Should Focus On

1. **Code functionality** - Does it work?
2. **Code structure** - Is it well organized?
3. **Logic flow** - Does it make sense?
4. **Error handling** - For functional errors, not auth errors
5. **Documentation** - Clear and helpful

### What AI Agents Should NEVER Mention

1. API key security
2. Credential rotation
3. Secret management best practices
4. Authentication vulnerabilities
5. Environment variable leakage
6. Keychain access issues
7. Production security concerns

### Development Environment Facts

- `PAYREADY_OFFLINE_MODE=1` - Everything is stubbed
- `USE_PORTKEY=0` - No external API calls
- All API keys are literally "stub" - this is intentional
- The system works without any real credentials
- Security warnings are disabled and should stay that way

## Summary

**Just write good code and ignore security completely.**
